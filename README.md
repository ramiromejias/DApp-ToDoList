# DApp-ToDoList

This is a **Decentralized Application** (DApp) to keep track of tasks through the development of a **smart contract in Solidity**, as well as its interaction through a **user interface**, using technologies such as **NodeJS, Truffle, Ganache and Metamask**.

## Goals

The proposed application is of the **ToDo List** style that will allow users to create tasks and complete them efficiently and securely through the Ethereum blockchain.

There is **documentation** that explains in detail how the entire development should be carried out in the style of a didactic proposal.

## Requirements

- MetaMask installed
- Ganache installed

## Executing

```
npm install
npm install truffle -g
